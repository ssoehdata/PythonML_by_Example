Clustering - grouping data based on commonality. Often used in exploratory analysis.
	     k-means clustering is an example algorithm used for clustering. 


Association - The co-occurrence of particular values of two or more features.
	      Common use case is in outlier (anomaly) detection. 

Projection -  Mapping the original feature space to a reduced dimensional space 
	      while retaining or extracting a set of principle variables. 
	      t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) is an example of 		      dimensionality reduction (used in ch7). 

k-means clustering - Partitions data into k groups based on feature similarities.
		     Each k cluster is specified by a centroid (center or cluster),
                     and each data sample belongs to the cluster with the nearest
                     centroid.
