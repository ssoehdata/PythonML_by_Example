This chapter covers another example of Unsupervised Learning:
	 Clustering and Topic Modeling.
This is accomplished by using a variety of techniques on various datasets
(iris, 20 Newsgroups).


Topics and Techniques covered include: 
 - Learning without guidance(unsupervised learning)
 - k-means clustering
 - clustering newsgroups data 
 - discovering underlying topics in newsgroups
 - LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
 - NMF (Non-negative matrix factorization)
