This chapter introduces Natural Language Processing (NLP):
This is achieved by examining a newsgroup dataset (20Newsgroups data).


Topics and Techniques covered include: 
	- overview of some NLP libraries and NLP basics
	- obtaining the newsgroups dataset 
	- exploring the dataset 
	- visualizing the data  with t-SNE
	- feature exploration for the textual data 
	- representing words with dense-vectors / word embedding 
	
	
 
Terms and Definitions: 

Tokenization - task of breaking a sequence into fragments(can be words, sentences, 			characters). Delimiters and other characters are removed, and what 
		remains are the tokens. 
Unigrams   -token comprised of one word 
Bigram 	   -token comprised of two consecutive words 
Trigrams   - three consecutive words 
n-grams    - n consecutive words


t-SNE     - t-distriubuted Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, embeds high-dimensional
	    data into a low-dimensional (usually 2 or 3 -dimensional) space while
	    preserving as much as possible the local structure and pairwise similarities of 	    the data.
