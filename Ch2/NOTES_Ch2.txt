This chapter demonstrates a Naive Bayes recommender system.
This is accomplished by building a movie recommendation system (an example 
of supervised learning using binary classification) using the Naive Bayes method.

Topics and Techniques learned in this chapter project included: 

-Classification
-Implementing Naive Bayes (incl. its theoretical underpinnings)
-Building a movie recommender with Naive Bayes 
-Evaluating classifier performance 
-Tuning models with Cross-Validation


In Baye's theorem the probability P(A|B) is the probability that A occurs given that B is true.

P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)
