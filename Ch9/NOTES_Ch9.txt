This chapter focusses on Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifiers:
This will be implemented on a facial image dataset.


Topics and Techniques covered include: 
	-PCA(Principle Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique
	which boosts the performance of the classifier.

	-Support Vector Regression

Hyperplanes - SVM classifiers find an optimal dimensional space that best segregates
	      observations.

	      It is a plane of n-1 dimensions that separates the n-dimensional feature
	      space fot he observations into two spaces.
	      
	      The optimal hyperplane is picked such that the distance from its nearest
	      points in each space to itself is maximized- these nearest points are the
	      support vectors. 

Support Vectors - the nearest points to the hyperlane.
